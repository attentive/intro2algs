# intro2algs

Just implementations of classic selection sort, insertion sort and Newton-Raphson numerical approximation
in the sort of C++ that was considered good style (with the possible exception of my enormous tab spacing) 
in around 2009.

The algorithms themselves are drawn from the text and exercises o [Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) aka "Cormen" after one of its authors.
